The second you pull money out of your 401(k)- without rolling over to an IRA or other 401(k) plan- you incur an immediate income tax liability on the entire amount of the withdrawal. You also lose the benefit of future tax deferral, although this isn’t the end of the world. 
<p>Investment real estate has tax advantages of its own, including the deferral of capital gains tax through 1031 exchanges and just plain holding on to properties, rather than selling. However, rental income is generally taxable outside of retirement plans.</p>

You may get tagged with a 10 percent early withdrawal penalty if you are under age 59½. The penalty is waived if you are over age 55 and have left your job, however. The 10 percent penalty is on the full amount you withdraw, not just on the 80 percent you actually receive from your employer.

				You may be able to borrow money from your 401(k) to jump-start your investment in real estate. Not every plan allows loans, but if your employer’s plan allows it, you can take a loan from your 401(k) plan, invest it in real estate, and take up to five years to pay the loan back with interest.
				
				<p>This will allow you to take the cash while still deferring income tax and avoiding early withdrawal penalties. Moreover, there’s no $10,000 limit – meaning you can take your entire down payment from your 401(k).</p>
